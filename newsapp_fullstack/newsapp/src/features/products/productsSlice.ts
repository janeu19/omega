/**
 * Documentation for the `counterSlice` Redux Slice
 *
 * Overview:
 * This Redux slice is named 'products' but is structured to manage a counter's state within an application.
 * It defines an initial state and currently contains no reducers to modify this state. This setup suggests
 * that it is a template or a placeholder for future development.
 *
 * State Structure:
 * - `value`: A number representing the current value of the counter.
 *
 * Initial State:
 * - The `value` is initialized to `0`.
 *
 * Reducers:
 * - This slice currently does not contain any reducers. To make it functional, reducers such as `increment`,
 *   `decrement`, and `reset` can be added to modify the state based on dispatched actions.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To use this slice effectively, you'll need to define reducers within it that correspond to the actions your
 * application will dispatch. Here's an example of how you might add an `increment` reducer:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * reducers: {
 *   increment: (state) => {
 *     state.value += 1;
 *   },
 *   // Additional reducers can be defined here
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * After defining the necessary reducers, you can dispatch actions from your React components to interact with
 * the slice's state. Ensure the slice is included in your store configuration to make its state accessible
 * and modifiable across your application.
 *
 * Integration:
 * Include this slice in your Redux store by importing the reducer and adding it to the `reducers` object
 * in your store's configuration. Dispatch actions defined in the slice to modify the application's state.
 *
 * Example Component Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * import React from 'react';
 * import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
 * import { increment } from './counterSlice';
 *
 * export function CounterButton() {
 *   const dispatch = useDispatch();
 *
 *   return (
 *     <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>
 *       Increment counter
 *     </button>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note:
 * Ensure to update the slice name and add the necessary reducers and actions to make this slice functional
 * for its intended purpose, whether managing a counter or product-related functionalities.
