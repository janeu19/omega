/**
 * Documentation for the `historyListSlice` Redux Slice
 *
 * Overview:
 * The `historyListSlice` manages the application's browsing history feature. It is responsible for storing,
 * updating, and clearing a list of history items that the user has interacted with. This slice utilizes Redux Toolkit
 * for efficient state management and leverages localStorage to persist the history across user sessions.
 *
 * State Structure:
 * - historyItems (HistoryItem[]): An array of objects where each object represents a distinct history item.
 *
 * Actions:
 * - addToHistory (HistoryItem): Accepts a history item and either adds it to the state or updates its position
 *   if it already exists, ensuring the most recently interacted item is always at the front.
 * - removeFromHistory (string): Removes a history item based on its imageUrl.
 * - clearHistory (): Clears all history items from the state.
 *
 * Reducers:
 * - The reducers for `addToHistory`, `removeFromHistory`, and `clearHistory` provide the logic for updating
 *   the state in response to dispatched actions. These reducers also synchronize the state with localStorage
 *   to ensure persistence.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Import the actions from the slice and dispatch them in your components to interact with the history state. For example,
 * to add a new item to the history, dispatch the `addToHistory` action with the appropriate payload.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```javascript
 * import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
 * import { addToHistory } from './historySlice';
 *
 * function MyComponent() {
 *   const dispatch = useDispatch();
 *   const historyItem = { id: '1', imageUrl: '...', title: 'Example', lastUpdated: '...', url: '...' };
 *
 *   const handleAddToHistory = () => {
 *     dispatch(addToHistory(historyItem));
 *   };
 *
 *   return <button onClick={handleAddToHistory}>Add to History</button>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Integration:
 * To integrate the `historyListSlice` into your application, include it in your Redux store setup. Ensure that
 * your application's store is configured with `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit, and include this slice's reducer
 * in the `reducer` field of the store's configuration.
 *
 * Note:
 * The `historyListSlice` is designed to be flexible and easily integrated into various application structures. It
 * can be extended or modified to suit more complex requirements, such as handling different types of history items or
 * integrating with backend services for cross-device history synchronization.
 *
 * It is important to consider privacy and security implications when storing and managing user history. Ensure that
 * sensitive information is adequately protected and comply with any relevant data protection regulations.
