/*
DetailPage Component Documentation:

This component is responsible for rendering the detail view of a specific category's articles. It utilizes several custom utility functions and components for its operation.

Dependencies:
- react-router-dom's useLocation for accessing route state.
- Utility functions for filtering/slicing articles and calculating time elapsed.
- Reusable UI components (CategoryHeader, Loader, Card) for consistent design.

Structure:
- The component uses a React fragment to group the list of elements.
- It dynamically renders a grid of Card components based on the category data passed via route state.

Functionality:
- On component mount, it retrieves the category data from the location state.
- It displays a header for the category and a grid of articles.
- Each article is presented in a Card component, which includes the article's source, title, description, image, and the time elapsed since its publication.

Best Practices:
- Utilize reusable components for UI consistency and maintainability.
- Keep utility functions separate for better testing and reuse across components.
