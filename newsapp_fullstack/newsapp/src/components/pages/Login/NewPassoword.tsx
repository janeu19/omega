// Documentation for NewPassword Component

/**
 * The `NewPassword` component allows users to set a new password, typically as part of a password reset flow. This component is designed to be used after the user has verified their identity, for example, through an OTP (One-Time Password) verification step.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * This component should be rendered on a dedicated "Set New Password" page or modal, accessible after the user has successfully passed the initial verification step (e.g., email verification or OTP verification).
 *
 * ## Features
 * - Two password fields: one for the new password and another to confirm the new password.
 * - Basic client-side validation can be easily implemented to ensure that both password fields match and meet any specified security criteria (e.g., minimum length).
 * - A clear and user-friendly interface to guide the user through the process of setting a new password.
 *
 * ## State Management
 * - `password`: Holds the value entered in the "New Password" field.
 * - `confirmPassword`: Holds the value entered in the "Confirm New Password" field.
 * - `error`: Stores any validation errors or other error messages to be displayed to the user.
 *
 * ## Event Handlers
 * - `onChange` handlers for both input fields update the component's state with the user's input.
 *
 * ## Styling
 * - Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive and modern design. The class names can be customized as per the application's styling guidelines.
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 * - The component can be integrated with backend services to update the user's password. This typically involves sending a POST request to a password reset endpoint upon form submission.
 * - It can be part of a multi-step password reset flow, following an identity verification step.
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 * - Ensure secure transmission of the new password values to the backend (e.g., over HTTPS).
 * - Implement adequate server-side validation to enforce password strength requirements.
 * - Clear sensitive information from state after the password has been successfully updated or if the user navigates away from the page.
 *
 * ## Example Implementation
 * The `NewPassword` component can be used as follows within a React application:
 * ```jsx
 * <NewPassword />
 * ```
 * Ensure to handle form submission and integration with the backend password reset functionality to complete the flow.
