/**
 * Documentation for the sendotp Function
 *
 * Overview:
 * The `sendotp` function is an endpoint in an Express application that sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to a user's email
 * for verification purposes. It leverages the `nodemailer` library to send emails via Gmail and updates the user's record
 * in a MongoDB database with the generated OTP.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - A MongoDB database with a `User` model.
 * - An email account set up for sending emails, preferably with an app password for enhanced security.
 * - The `nodemailer` library installed in the project.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * 1. Generates a 4-digit OTP.
 * 2. Searches for the user in the database using the email provided in the request body.
 * 3. Sets up nodemailer with Gmail credentials.
 * 4. Sends an email to the user with the generated OTP.
 * 5. Updates the user's record in the database with the OTP.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - Returns a 404 response if no user is found with the provided email.
 * - Returns a 500 response if there is an error in sending the email or updating the database.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To use this function, it should be connected to an Express route as follows:
 * ```javascript
 * const express = require('express');
 * const { sendotp } = require('./path/to/sendotp');
 * const app = express();
 * 
 * app.post('/send-otp', sendotp);
 * 
 * app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
 * ```
 * 
 * Security Note:
 * - Never hard-code sensitive information (like email passwords) directly in the code. Use environment variables or
 *   configuration files to manage such data securely.
 * - Consider implementing rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent abuse of the OTP mechanism.
