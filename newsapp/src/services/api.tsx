/**
 * Documentation for News API Utilities
 * 
 * Overview:
 * This file provides utility functions to interact with the News API, facilitating the fetching of top headlines
 * by country and searching for news articles based on a specific query. It uses axios for HTTP requests and is
 * designed to be imported and utilized by other parts of the application requiring news data.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - `getHeadlineByCountry`: Fetches top headlines for a specific country (India, in this case) from the News API.
 *    Returns a Promise that resolves to the response data or logs an error.
 * 
 * - `fetchSearchDataApi`: Performs a search query on the News API and returns articles based on the query's popularity.
 *    Accepts a search query string as a parameter. Returns a Promise that resolves to the response data or logs an error.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To use these functions, import them into your component or service and call them with the appropriate parameters. 
 * For example, to fetch top headlines in India:
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * import { getHeadlineByCountry } from './newsApiUtilities';
 * 
 * async function fetchHeadlines() {
 *   const headlines = await getHeadlineByCountry();
 *   console.log(headlines);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * To perform a search with a query:
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * import { fetchSearchDataApi } from './newsApiUtilities';
 * 
 * async function searchNews(query) {
 *   const results = await fetchSearchDataApi(query);
 *   console.log(results);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note:
 * These utility functions are configured to use a static API key for the News API. In a production environment,
 * consider implementing more secure methods of storing and using API keys, such as environment variables or secure
 * vaults, especially if the application is to be deployed publicly.
