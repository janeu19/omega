/**
 * Documentation for the App Component and AppContent Component
 *
 * Overview:
 * The `App` component serves as the root component for the React News App. It wraps the entire application
 * within the `DarkModeProvider` context to manage dark mode settings across the application. The `AppContent`
 * component then utilizes the `useDarkMode` hook to determine the current theme (dark or light) and sets up
 * routing for the application using React Router. This setup enables navigation between different pages of the
 * application, such as the home page, login/signup pages, favorite news, browsing history, and more.
 *
 * Components and Routes:
 * - `HomeComponent`: The landing page of the application.
 * - `Login`: A page where users can log in.
 * - `Signup`: A page for new users to sign up.
 * - `FavNews`: Displays the user's favorited news articles.
 * - `HistoryLists`: Shows a list of recently viewed news articles.
 * - `ForgetPassword`, `OTPVerification`, `NewPassword`: Components related to the password reset flow.
 * - `DetailPage`: A detailed view for a specific news category.
 * - `NotFound`: A fallback component displayed when a route does not match any defined paths.
 *
 * Dark Mode:
 * The application supports dark mode, which is managed via the `DarkModeProvider` context. This context provides
 * the `isDarkMode` flag and a mechanism to toggle the theme. The `AppContent` component uses the `isDarkMode` flag
 * to apply appropriate CSS classes for dark or light mode.
 *
 * Routing:
 * The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing. Routes are defined within the `AppContent` component to
 * map URLs to their respective components. This setup facilitates navigation and ensures that users can access
 * different parts of the application through unique URLs.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To run the application, ensure you have the necessary components and context providers set up as shown in the
 * provided code. The application should be wrapped in a `<Router>` component at the root level to enable routing.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *   return (
 *     <DarkModeProvider>
 *       <AppContent />
 *     </DarkModeProvider>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note:
 * The application requires the `react-toastify` library for displaying toast notifications and `react-router-dom`
 * for routing. Ensure these dependencies are installed and properly configured in your project.
 *
 * Enhancements:
 * - Implement authentication state management to conditionally render routes based on the user's login status.
 * - Extend the dark mode functionality to allow users to toggle the theme from a UI control.
 * - Consider using lazy loading for components associated with routes to improve load times and performance.
