// Documentation for OTPVerification Component

/**
 * The `OTPVerification` component is designed to facilitate the OTP (One-Time Password) verification process as part of a password reset or account verification workflow. It allows the user to input an OTP they have received via email and set a new password for their account.
 *
 * ## Props
 * - `email`: String. The email address to which the OTP was sent. This is used to inform the user where to look for the OTP.
 * - `onVerify`: Function. A callback function that is executed upon successful OTP verification. This can be used for further actions in the parent component, such as updating the UI or redirecting the user.
 *
 * ## State
 * - `otp`: String. Holds the value of the OTP input by the user.
 * - `password`: String. Holds the value of the new password input by the user.
 *
 * ## Functionality
 * - The component renders two input fields for the user to enter the OTP and their new password, along with a submission button.
 * - Upon clicking the submission button, the component sends a POST request to a predefined endpoint (`/submit-otp`) with the OTP and new password.
 * - If the verification is successful (indicated by a response code of 200 from the server), the user is shown a success message using `toast` notifications, and they are redirected to the login page.
 * - Error handling is implemented for failed verification attempts, with errors logged to the console. A more user-friendly approach, such as displaying error messages to the user, can be adopted.
 *
 * ## Integration
 * - The component should be integrated into the password reset flow after the user requests an OTP. It requires an active backend endpoint capable of handling OTP verification and password updates.
 * - The `email` prop must be dynamically set based on the user's email address to personalize the instruction message.
 * - The `onVerify` callback can be used for additional logic after successful verification, such as state updates or API calls to fetch user data.
 *
 * ## Styling
 * - Styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS for a consistent and responsive design. The styles can be customized to fit the application's design theme.
 * - The component uses conditional rendering to display error messages, enhancing user feedback and interaction  */
