/*
Store Configuration Documentation:

This code snippet configures a Redux store using Redux Toolkit's configureStore method, which provides sensible defaults and middleware integration for the store setup.

Dependencies:
- @reduxjs/toolkit: Package that offers tools to simplify Redux development.

Structure:
- The store configuration is typically centralized in a store.js (or store.ts for TypeScript) file.

Explanation:
- The configureStore call sets up the store with multiple reducers corresponding to different features of the application. Each key in the reducer object represents a piece of the state, managed by the respective slice.

Usage:
- Components interact with the store using hooks like useSelector and useDispatch from react-redux.
- Slices define the shape of the state, reducers for handling state changes, and actions to trigger those reducers.

Best Practices:
- Maintain slices cohesively with their state, reducers, and actions for better maintainability.
- Utilize Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createAsyncThunk for simpler state updates and handling asynchronous logic.
